    //2. After the underlying MGElement instance has been created from the MGUI.Core.UI.XAML.Element instance,
    //      Element.ApplyBaseSettings copies the Bindings to MGElement.Metadata[BindingsMetadataKey], temporarily storing the data on the MGElement instance
    //3. After the entire XAML content is done being parsed, Element.ProcessBindings is called (at the end of Window.ToElement())
    //4. Element.ProcessBindings calls DataBindingsManager.AddBinding to finalize the databinding
    //Step #4 is intentionally deferred until after the entire window is done parsing, because otherwise bindings to ElementName might not work properly

    //      So Button A's bindings cannot be resolved until Button B is parsed)
